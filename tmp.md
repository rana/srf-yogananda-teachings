# TODO

Focus on reading experience. 

How to make it world-class and amazingly accessible to all humans of Earth?

How can we make this a highly serviceful, delightful experience for the reader?

Some ideas.

As reading a paragraph from Autobiography of a Yogi. Show a side panel of related works across whole library. 

Perhaps show top three related reading with option to explore all related? Auto show related readings without user searching. Pre-calculate all related text? What value is there in sentence level embeddings vs paragraph level embeddings? Paragraph level embedding enough?

Is there potential paragraaph (or other unit) user graph traversal of all the readings. If we show related one degree of relation, navigate, then navigate to the next degree of navigation, that may be a novel way to travel the library.

Start with readings, and eventually also transcribe all audio and video. Show related audio/video in side panel as auto-suggestion just as books.

Be pro-active in helping the reader with anything. Search bar is good. Being pro-active in suggesting related is taking the next step.

What features are we not asking about?

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What questions am I not asking?

Search bar background text: "How can I help you?"

- Include an end-to-end test of related text to ensure it is providing high-quality suggestions. The teaching portal is focused quality teaching.

Beyond what we have already defined.

What would make the reading experience world-class and amazingly accessible?

What innovate concepts might we consider?

What simple touches would uplift the heart?

Consider SRF website imagery?

Would you like to see, intuit, explore, design, build, or anything while that happens?

What do you think of:

When a version of the teaching portal is released three types of summaries of the whole site may be produced for stakeholders.

It could be executive summary of whole site. Include high level features, approaches, and so on. Have a high-level, medium-level, and detailed-level equivcalent document for different audiences. Produce these documents for each release.

Make snapshots of SRF 
- mobile app for members for ideas.
- member's portal for ideas

---

Reflect through markdown documents looking for coherence and alignment. I'm preparing for eventual implementation. 

What would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

Would you simplify anything?

Would you remove anything?

Is the design crystalline?

What are you not enthusiastic about?

What are you enthusiastic about?

What do you see for, against and through?

Do all our designs support multilingual? That is core to supporting Earth's population.

For example, REST API suport multilingual design as needed?

Embedding cross-reference to same langauge only?

Other questions to ask which we benefit from?

When I'm reading I may wish to share:
- Via email, download, social media (eventually)
- Format text or PDF
- Text may provide url to origin and short title
- PDF may contain more book like feel
- May share paragraph, chapter, whole book
- May use SRF lotuc branding (Similar to photo watermark)

Let's thoroughly think through sharing of each medium starting with email.

-
Dwell feature for web. How about mouse over paragraph for 5s starts dwell effect? Mouse move/click releases dwell effect?


-
How are we serving Earth humans?
- Consider people with little means?
- Consider perspectives of each Earth culture? Are we providing sufficient cultural enagement, perspective shift, and what else?
- Can rural minimal infrastructure people have a good experience? How can we better serve their needs?
- What am I blind to thus far? I am an American software engineer in California with limited perspective. How would you ensure we are serving all of Earth?

1. Let's think through deploying the whole app release from GitHub. How would we approach it? We consider terraform. Is that appropriate to interface to all services. Consider we may eventually have multiple environments. Migration to GitLab may occur.

2. How are "Related Teachings" distinct from "Continue the Thread"?

3. Consider the entire stack for cost optimization. Would using AWS services benefit us at all. Consider Lambdas, teh stated SRF tech stack. Be open to alternatives when there is a compelling value proposition.

4. Let's deeply consider the Global South. Have we done everything to serve them?

5. Let's explore design for mobile apps (Android, iOS, etc?). We can prioritize towards end phases. The sooner we design for, the better?

What questions am I not asking?

What would serve our mission well?

Are there any improvements to the reading experience?

1. Look at the whole project from an operational point fo view. Are there gaps in our design? What are the operational costs? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

2. Is there value in re-number the ADRs to sequential based on reading for your benefit? Currently they are number based on historical creation time. What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

3. Are the markdown documents coherent? Are there obsolete info? Are there incorrect associations? Labels? Do the diagrams in DESIGN.md need revisions? Are the diagram endpoints still valid? Do the diagrams have ommissions? Would you use as is? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

4. What are the blind spots? Trace through each phase? Trace through operations through architecture. What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

5. Inhabit the heart and mind of each of the cultures: spanish, german, french, italian, portuguese, english, japanese, hindi, bengali. What are we doing, if anything, doesn't make sense from that cultural lense? How can we serve each culture as best as possible? What are our blind spots? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

6. Expand list of REST endpoints? Evaluate adding REST endpoints:
- `/v1/places/[slug]`
- `/v1/people/[slug]`
- `/v1/explore(or theme, or similar)/[courage|etc]` for ADR-013: Teaching Topics — Curated Thematic Entry Points

What other REST endpoints might be helpful?

And, what value or convenience, if any, would each endpoint provide?

What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.
