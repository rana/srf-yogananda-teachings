## Seeker Experience Review

Evaluate the reading and discovery experience:

1. **First encounter** — What does a new visitor experience? Is the entry point clear, welcoming, non-overwhelming?
2. **Reading flow** — Is the reading experience world-class? Typography, spacing, scroll behavior, related content surfacing?
3. **Proactive helpfulness** — Does the portal anticipate what the reader might want next? Related teachings, cross-references, "Continue the Thread" vs "Related Teachings"?
4. **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Screen readers, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, touch targets. Experience on low-end devices?
5. **Progressive enhancement** — Base experience complete without JavaScript? Graceful degradation on slow connections?
6. **Delight** — What simple touches uplift the heart? What makes the experience feel crafted rather than generic?
7. **Practice Bridge** — Do "Go Deeper" signposts feel natural, not salesy? Does the path from reading to practice invitation feel organic?
8. **Discovery** — Can the reader find what they need? Search, browse, thematic entry points, knowledge graph? Multiple paths to the same content?
9. **Sharing** — Can the reader share a meaningful passage with a friend? Is the shared artifact beautiful and functional?
10. **Return visits** — What brings someone back? Reading progress, bookmarks, new content notifications (calm, not aggressive)?
