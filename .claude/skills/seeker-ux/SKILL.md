## Seeker Experience Review

Evaluate the reading and discovery experience:

1. **First encounter** — What does a new visitor experience? Is the entry point clear, welcoming, non-overwhelming?
2. **Reading flow** — Is the reading experience world-class? Typography, spacing, scroll behavior, related content surfacing?
3. **Proactive helpfulness** — Does the portal anticipate what the reader might want next? Related teachings, cross-references, "Continue the Thread" vs "Related Teachings"?
4. **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Screen readers, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, touch targets. Experience on low-end devices?
5. **Progressive enhancement** — Base experience complete without JavaScript? Graceful degradation on slow connections?
6. **Delight** — What simple touches uplift the heart? What makes the experience feel crafted rather than generic?
7. **Practice Bridge** — Do "Go Deeper" signposts feel natural, not salesy? Does the path from reading to practice invitation feel organic?
8. **Discovery** — Can the reader find what they need? Search, browse, thematic entry points, knowledge graph? Multiple paths to the same content?
9. **Sharing** — Can the reader share a meaningful passage with a friend? Is the shared artifact beautiful and functional?
10. **Return visits** — What brings someone back? Reading progress, bookmarks, new content notifications (calm, not aggressive)?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every insight:
1. The UX finding (friction, opportunity, or strength)
2. Where it manifests
3. The proposed improvement
4. Which phase it belongs to

Present as an action list. No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

**Hard constraints:**
- Maximum 8 findings per run. Prioritize by impact on the seeker's experience.
- If no $ARGUMENTS focus area is given, evaluate only the top 3 most impactful dimensions rather than all 10.
- Write findings to SEEKER-UX-AUDIT.md incrementally. Do not accumulate a single large response.

**Document reading strategy:**
- CONTEXT.md and ROADMAP.md: read fully (short documents).
- DESIGN.md: read UX, typography, and interaction sections relevant to the focused dimension(s). Skip infrastructure sections.
- DECISIONS.md: read the index first. Only read specific ADRs relevant to the focused dimension(s).

**If output would exceed comfortable length:**
Stop. Write what you have to SEEKER-UX-AUDIT.md. Tell the user which dimensions remain unreviewed and offer to continue.
