## Cultural Perspective Audit

Inhabit the perspective of: $ARGUMENTS

From this perspective:

1. **Language & communication** — Does the portal communicate naturally and respectfully? Are translations adequate? Is the tone culturally appropriate?
2. **Visual & interaction design** — Do the design tokens, imagery, and interaction patterns feel welcoming or alien? Cultural associations of colors, symbols, layouts?
3. **Technical access** — Can this person actually use the portal? Device availability, bandwidth constraints, data costs, browser diversity.
4. **Spiritual context** — How does Yogananda's teaching intersect with this person's existing spiritual or philosophical framework? What's the entry point?
5. **Content relevance** — Which books, themes, or teachings have particular resonance? Which might need additional context?
6. **Assumptions examined** — What does the current design assume about the user that may not hold for this perspective?
7. **What uplifts?** — What simple touches would make this person feel welcomed and served?
8. **What alienates?** — What might feel exclusionary, insensitive, or simply confusing?

For every finding:
1. The specific concern or opportunity
2. Where it manifests (design element, content decision, UX flow)
3. The proposed change or consideration
4. Where it should be documented (DESIGN.md section, ADR, CONTEXT.md)

Present as an action list. No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

If the analysis is extensive, deliver the highest-priority findings first. Keep output concise — dense observations, not expansive prose. Note remaining sections available on request.
