# Language Demographics — Master Source Table

**Purpose:** Trace every population number in ADR-128 to a verifiable source. Enable human validation of statistics that drive feature ordering.

**Why this matters:** ADR-128 governs roadmap prioritization — which languages ship first, which features wait. The demographic data underpinning these decisions originated from an AI-generated research document (`Prioritizing Global Language Rollout.md`, Gemini 3 Pro). While the citations appear legitimate, AI can hallucinate URLs or misattribute numbers. This file provides a human-verifiable audit trail.

## Validation Status

| Data Category | Status | Action Needed |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Speaker counts (Ethnologue 2025) | **Indirectly verified** via 3 secondary sources (S10, S11, S12) | Spot-check 3-4 languages against Ethnologue summary or Wikipedia to confirm consistency |
| Internet % — Tier 4 verified countries | **Directly verified** from DataReportal 2025 country reports | Re-verify at arc boundaries |
| Internet % — Core languages (ADR-128 original) | **Indirectly verified** from reference doc (Gemini-generated) citing ITU/DataReportal | Fetch DataReportal country reports for India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Thailand |
| Internet % — YSS-contributed languages | **Estimated** based on Indian state-level assumptions | Fetch Indian state-level connectivity data (TRAI reports or similar) |
| Hindi-specific internet % (~70%) | **Needs validation** | India country-wide is 55.3%. The 70% for Hindi speakers needs state-level data for UP, MP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Delhi, etc. |
| Reachable calculations | **Derived** (speakers × internet %) | Recompute after validating inputs |

## Known Risks

1. **Ethnologue is paywalled.** All speaker counts come from secondary sources reporting Ethnologue data. The secondary sources agree with each other, which suggests they're reporting the same upstream data — but we haven't verified against Ethnologue directly.

2. **Internet penetration for Hindi speakers (70%) may be optimistic.** India's country-wide penetration is 55.3% (DataReportal 2025). The 70% figure assumes Hindi speakers (concentrated in northern India) have higher-than-average connectivity. This needs TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) state-level data.

3. **Internet penetration for Indic regional languages (60%) is an estimate.** Telugu, Tamil, Kannada numbers assume state-level connectivity in southern India. Southern Indian states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh/Telangana) tend to have higher connectivity than the national average, so 60% may be conservative. But it's unverified.

4. **French internet penetration (37%) is a blended average.** France alone is >90%. Francophone Africa is ~25%. The 37% weights across all 312M speakers, most of whom are in Africa. The reachable number (~116M) is dominated by European French speakers.

5. **Chinese reachable (924M) is technically accurate but practically misleading.** The Great Firewall means a Vercel-hosted portal cannot serve these users without China-specific infrastructure (ICP license, China-based CDN). Effective reachable is near zero for the current architecture.

6. **AI-generated reference document.** The `Prioritizing Global Language Rollout.md` was generated by Gemini 3 Pro. While its 53 citations appear to reference real sources with real URLs, AI can fabricate plausible-looking citations. Each citation should be spot-checked by clicking through.

## Human Validation Checklist

A human reviewer should:

- [ ] Click 5-6 citation URLs from the reference doc to verify they exist and contain the claimed data
- [ ] Cross-check English, Hindi, and Spanish speaker counts against Wikipedia (S13) as a quick sanity check
- [ ] Verify the DataReportal Tier 4 numbers by visiting the URLs above
- [ ] Source India state-level internet data from TRAI (trai.gov.in) to validate the Hindi 70% and Indic 60% estimates
- [ ] Confirm Bengali internet penetration with a Bangladesh-specific DataReportal report
- [ ] Assess whether any Yogananda translations exist for Arabic, Russian, Indonesian, or Korean (this determines `content_availability`)
