## [00:28:00 – 00:35:19] Special Focus: The New Online Teachings Portal

Brother Chidananda shares a story about a recent meeting with a prominent British philanthropist. This individual and his wife had read Yogananda's works and concluded that the world's problems are symptoms of a deeper issue: the state of human consciousness. They felt the most effective way to help humanity was to support a shift in global consciousness.

**The Proposal:** The philanthropist asked Brother Chidananda, *"What can we do to help SRF make Paramahansa Yogananda's books available freely throughout the world?"*

**The Gift:** The couple's foundation made a "munificent offer" to endow a new project.

**The Project:** A world-class online teachings portal to be launched later in 2026.

**The Goal:** To vastly expand the availability of the teachings globally using modern technology.

**Non-Goal:** We do not include the SRF Lessons, which are reserved and private.

### Key Features Announced

- **Free Access** — A digital platform where anyone can freely access Yogananda's books and SRF/YSS publications.
- **Multi-Language Support** — Content will be available in English and all translated languages, with efforts to facilitate new translations.
- **Intelligent Query Tool** — Users will be able to ask questions and search across the entire library of books to find specific answers or topics (e.g., *"How do I deal with fear?"*).
- **Additional Features** — Lessons, audio/video content, and other elements are still in development and will be announced in the coming months.
