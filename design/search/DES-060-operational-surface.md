## DES-060: Operational Surface — Health, Deployment, and Traceability

A unified operational layer providing health monitoring, deployment ceremony, document integrity validation, and design-artifact traceability. Consolidates PRO-035 (Release Tagging), PRO-036 (Operational Health), PRO-037 (Document Integrity CI), and PRO-039 (Design-Artifact Traceability) into a single implementation specification.

### Governing Decisions

- ADR-095 (Observability Strategy) — SLI/SLO targets
- ADR-018 (CI-Agnostic Deployment Scripts) — scripts in `/scripts/`
- ADR-020 (Multi-Environment Infrastructure Design) — branch=environment
- ADR-098 (Documentation Architecture) — document integrity
- ADR-094 (Testing Strategy) — test traceability
- PRO-035 (Release Tagging and Deployment Ceremony)
- PRO-036 (Operational Health Surface and SLI/SLO Framework)
- PRO-037 (Document Integrity Validation in CI)
- PRO-039 (Design-Artifact Traceability)

### Milestone Delivery

| Milestone | What Ships |
|-----------|-----------|
| **1a** | `doc-validate.sh` (identifier cross-reference integrity), `status.sh` (AI self-orientation), `release-tag.sh` (semantic release tagging) |
| **1c** | `/api/v1/health` (JSON health endpoint), `/ops` page (operational dashboard), deploy manifest generation, `deploy.sh` (deployment ceremony script) |
| **2a** | CI traceability roll-up, `@implements`/`@validates` coverage reporting |

---

### Layer 1: Health Endpoint — `/api/v1/health`

**Milestone 1c.** JSON endpoint returning system health for synthetic monitoring and the `/ops` page.

```
GET /api/v1/health

Response:
{
  "status": "ok" | "degraded" | "down",
  "version": "1a.3",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 12 },
    "contentful": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 45 },
    "search": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 87 }
  },
  "deployment": {
    "tag": "v1a.3",
    "deployed_at": "2026-11-15T14:30:00Z",
    "environment": "production"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-11-15T15:00:00Z"
}
```

**SLI/SLO Numeric Targets (PRO-036):**

| SLI | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Search p95 latency | < 500ms | New Relic APM / Vercel Analytics |
| Availability | 99.5% uptime | New Relic Synthetics (2-min check interval) |
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | Vercel Analytics Core Web Vitals |
| Error rate | < 0.1% of requests | Sentry error count / Vercel request count |
| Search quality | >= 80% Recall@3 | Golden set evaluation (DES-058) |

These targets are tunable parameters per ADR-123 — initial values based on pre-production estimates. Revisit after first month of production traffic.

---

### Layer 2: Operational Dashboard — `/ops`

**Milestone 1c.** A Next.js page (not public-facing, but not auth-gated in Arc 1) presenting operational health for the human principal and AI sessions.

**Typography:** Merriweather 400 headings, Open Sans 400 body (operational page, not a reading page). `--srf-navy` headings, status colors: green `#2d7d46`, amber `#b8860b`, red `#c41e3a`.

**Data sources:** `/api/v1/health` (live), deploy manifest JSON (static file at `/.well-known/deploy-manifest.json`), `doc-validate.sh` output (CI artifact), traceability roll-up (CI artifact, Milestone 2a).

---

### Layer 3: Scripts

All scripts follow ADR-018 (CI-agnostic, runnable locally or from GitHub Actions).

#### `scripts/status.sh` — AI Self-Orientation (Milestone 1a)

Claude's first action in any development session. Prints a concise briefing:

```bash
./scripts/status.sh

# Output:
# Portal Status — 2026-11-15
# ──────────────────────────
# Version:     v1a.3
# Milestone:   1c (Deploy) — 12/15 deliverables complete
# Branch:      feature/crisis-detection
# Last deploy: v1a.3 (2 hours ago)
# Health:      ● OK (all checks passing)
#
# Document Integrity:
#   Identifiers: 234 total (130 ADR, 63 DES, 41 PRO)
#   Cross-ref errors: 0
#   Last validated: 2 hours ago (CI)
#
# Pending PROs: 18 proposed, 2 validated awaiting scheduling
# Open questions: 4 (see CONTEXT.md § Open Questions)
```

Sources: git tags, CI artifacts, PROPOSALS.md index parsing, CONTEXT.md open questions grep.

#### `scripts/doc-validate.sh` — Document Integrity (Milestone 1a)

Validates cross-reference integrity across all project documents:

1. **Identifier registry:** Scans all markdown files for ADR-NNN, DES-NNN, PRO-NNN declarations. Builds a registry.
2. **Cross-reference check:** Every identifier referenced in prose must exist in the registry. Flags dangling references.
3. **Title consistency:** For dual-homed identifiers (ADR/DES in both DECISIONS and design files), verifies titles match.
4. **Navigation table completeness:** Every DES file in `design/` has a row in DESIGN.md's navigation table.
5. **Index completeness:** Every PRO body has an index entry in PROPOSALS.md.

```bash
./scripts/doc-validate.sh

# Output:
# Document Integrity Check — 2026-11-15
# ──────────────────────────────────────
# Identifiers found: 234 (130 ADR, 63 DES, 41 PRO)
# Cross-references checked: 1,847
# ✓ All cross-references resolve
# ✓ All dual-homed titles match
# ✓ All design files indexed in DESIGN.md
# ✓ All PRO bodies have index entries
```

Runs in CI on every push to `main` that touches markdown files. Non-blocking in Arc 1 (advisory warnings); blocking in Arc 2+.

#### `scripts/release-tag.sh` — Release Tagging (Milestone 1a)

Creates annotated git tags with deployment metadata:

```bash
./scripts/release-tag.sh v1a.3

# Creates annotated tag with:
# - Version: v1a.3
# - Milestone: 1a
# - Commits since last tag
# - design_refs: [identifiers from @implements/@validates in changed files]
# - blast_tier: T1-T5 (auto-classified from git diff)
```

**Tag naming convention:** `v{arc}{milestone}.{patch}` — e.g., `v1a.1`, `v1a.2`, `v1c.0`, `v2a.1`. Milestone boundaries get `.0` tags. Patches increment within a milestone.

**Blast radius classification** (auto-detected from `git diff` since last tag):

| Tier | Scope | Detection Heuristic |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| T1 | Cosmetic | Only CSS, copy, or static asset changes |
| T2 | Single page | Changes in one `/app/` route |
| T3 | Multi-page | Changes in multiple `/app/` routes or `/lib/services/` |
| T4 | Data model | Changes in `/migrations/` or `/lib/services/` + schema |
| T5 | Cross-service | Changes in `/terraform/`, `.github/workflows/`, or external API contracts |

#### `scripts/deploy.sh` — Deployment Ceremony (Milestone 1c)

Orchestrates the full deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh v1c.0

# 1. Run doc-validate.sh (abort on errors)
# 2. Run test suite (abort on failures)
# 3. Create release tag via release-tag.sh
# 4. Generate deploy manifest (JSON)
# 5. Deploy to Vercel production
# 6. Verify /api/v1/health returns 200
# 7. Update deploy manifest with deployment URL
# 8. Push tag and manifest to GitHub
```

**Deploy manifest** (`/.well-known/deploy-manifest.json`):

```json
{
  "tag": "v1c.0",
  "deployed_at": "2026-12-01T14:30:00Z",
  "milestone": "1c",
  "blast_tier": "T3",
  "design_refs": ["DES-004", "ADR-048", "DES-058"],
  "commits": 23,
  "health_check": "ok",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

---

### Layer 4: Design-Artifact Traceability (PRO-039)

**Convention established Milestone 1a. CI roll-up Milestone 2a.**

Source files carry `@implements` comments; test files carry `@validates` comments. See PRO-039 for the full specification with examples.

**CI traceability step (Milestone 2a):** A GitHub Actions step greps the codebase for `@implements` and `@validates` annotations, cross-references against the identifier registry from `doc-validate.sh`, and produces a coverage report:

```
Identifier Coverage Report (v1a.3)
─────────────────────────────────
DES-004  Data Model           ██████████ implemented ✓  tested ✓  deployed v1a.1
DES-058  Search Quality       ████████░░ implemented ✓  tested ✓  deployed v1a.3
ADR-048  Chunking Strategy    ██████░░░░ implemented ✓  tested ○  not deployed
DES-017  Homepage             ░░░░░░░░░░ not started
```

Advisory in Arc 1 — no enforcement gate. Arc 2+ may add minimum coverage thresholds.

### Layer 5: Infrastructure-as-Intelligence

**Available from Milestone 1c.** The portal's infrastructure stack (Vercel Analytics, New Relic APM, CDN logs, structured application logs) already captures product-relevant signals at zero marginal cost and zero DELTA risk. Read these as product intelligence before adding explicit Amplitude events.

| Infrastructure Source | Signal | Product Intelligence | Available From |
|----------------------|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Vercel Analytics** | Core Web Vitals by route | FCP/LCP by page → which pages are slow for which populations? Hindi reading pages loading slowly = PRI-05 failure | Milestone 1c |
| **Vercel Analytics** | Traffic by route | Page popularity without any analytics events. `/search` vs. `/read/[book]` vs. `/quiet` — which surfaces do seekers use most? | Milestone 1c |
| **Vercel Analytics** | Geographic distribution | Country-level traffic heatmap. Validates `page_viewed` country data from a second source | Milestone 1c |
| **New Relic APM** | API latency by endpoint | `/api/v1/search` call volume = search usage. `/api/v1/passages` call volume = reading usage. Latency by endpoint reveals performance bottlenecks per feature | Milestone 3d |
| **CDN logs** | Bandwidth by asset type | Audio file bandwidth vs. font bandwidth vs. image bandwidth → audio demand volume without any explicit audio events | Milestone 1c |
| **CDN logs** | Cache hit rate by asset | High cache hit rate = repeat visitors (without identifying individuals). Low cache hit rate on audio = streaming vs. progressive download question | Milestone 1c |
| **Structured logs** | Search query patterns | Already logged (ADR-095). Zero-result queries → golden set candidates (DES-058). Query language distribution → real demand data for ADR-128 prioritization | Milestone 1c |
| **Structured logs** | Request volume by locale | `language` field on every request → real language demand, more granular than Amplitude's `requested_language` | Milestone 1c |
| **Sentry** | Error clustering by route and device | Errors concentrated on specific devices or browsers → broken experience for specific populations (PRI-05 failure detection) | Milestone 1c |

**Reading cadence:** Infrastructure-as-intelligence is not a dashboard — it is a periodic reading practice. At arc boundaries and milestone reviews, the human principal and AI review infrastructure signals for patterns that explicit analytics might miss. The `/ops` page (Layer 2) may surface selected infrastructure metrics in future milestones.

**Relationship to Amplitude:** Infrastructure signals answer "how much" and "how fast." Amplitude events answer "which feature" and "in what context." They are complementary. When an infrastructure signal (e.g., audio CDN bandwidth spike) raises a question, an Amplitude event (e.g., `audio_play_started` by language) provides the context. Do not duplicate: if infrastructure already answers a question, do not add an Amplitude event for the same signal.

### Accessibility

- `/ops` page: semantic HTML, screen-reader accessible, keyboard navigable
- Status indicators use both color and icon (●/◌/✕) — not color alone
- All operational data available as JSON via `/api/v1/health` for programmatic access
- ARIA label: "Portal operations dashboard — system health, deployments, and document integrity"

---

### Relationship to Other Sections

- **DES-039** (Infrastructure and Deployment) — DES-060 adds the operational *surface* (health endpoint, dashboard, deploy ceremony) to DES-039's infrastructure *foundation* (Terraform, CI, bootstrap)
- **DES-037** (Observability) — DES-060's SLI/SLO targets complement DES-037's logging and error tracking
- **DES-038** (Testing Strategy) — Design-artifact traceability (Layer 4) links tests back to governing specs
- **PRO-041** (Docs as Executable Specs) — Extracts testable assertions from design prose; PRO-039/DES-060 links existing tests back to design identifiers. Complementary directions.
