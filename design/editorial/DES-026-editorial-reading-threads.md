## DES-026: Editorial Reading Threads — "Teachings in Conversation"

Curated reading paths that trace a single spiritual theme through multiple books as a coherent progression. These are not AI-generated content — they are editorially sequenced arrangements of existing passages, like a museum exhibit: same artworks, thoughtful arrangement.

### Concept

The `chunk_relations` table (ADR-050) connects passages by semantic similarity. Editorial threads add a curated layer: human-selected passages sequenced to flow from recognition → understanding → practice → transcendence.

**Example:** "Yogananda on Fear" — 8 passages from 4 books, editorially ordered to build a coherent contemplation.

**Example:** "The Path of Practice" (ADR-104) — a curated passage sequence tracing Yogananda's published arc from reading to practice: why meditate → what meditation is → what Kriya Yoga is → the lineage (Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda) → the invitation to practice. All passages verbatim, all cited. The final entry signposts SRF's free Beginner's Meditation (`yogananda.org/a-beginners-meditation`) and the SRF Lessons (`yogananda.org/lessons`). This thread is the corpus-grounded version of what SRF's website provides through editorial copy — but here it is Yogananda's own voice making the invitation. Requires multi-book corpus (Milestone 3c+).

The "Seeking..." entry points already hint at this. Threads make the connection explicit and browsable.

### Schema

```sql
-- ============================================================
-- EDITORIAL THREADS (curated multi-book reading paths — Milestone 3c+)
-- ============================================================
CREATE TABLE editorial_threads (
 id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
 slug TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- URL slug: 'yogananda-on-fear'
 title TEXT NOT NULL, -- "Yogananda on Fear"
 description TEXT, -- Brief editorial introduction
 language TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en',
 is_published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false, -- human review gate
 created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
 updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now
);

CREATE TABLE thread_passages (
 id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
 thread_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES editorial_threads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
 chunk_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES book_chunks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
 position INTEGER NOT NULL, -- ordering within the thread
 editorial_note TEXT, -- optional editorial transition/context
 UNIQUE (thread_id, position)
);
```

### Route

`/threads` — Index of all published threads.
`/threads/[slug]` — A single thread: sequential passages with editorial transitions, each passage linking to "Read in context" in the full reader.

### Design

- Warm, unhurried layout — passages presented one at a time with generous whitespace
- Each passage shows full citation (book, chapter, page) and "Read in context →" link
- Optional editorial notes between passages provide transitions (never paraphrasing Yogananda — only "In this next passage, written twenty years later, Yogananda returns to..." style framing)
- The thread is a reading experience, not a list — designed for contemplation, not scanning
