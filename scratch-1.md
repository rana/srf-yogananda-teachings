How to ensure faithful reproduction of devanagari? Holy Science and others use it. Hindi is devanagari?

Trilingual UI text at which milestone? I lean to Arc 1 with trilingual book ingestion. How to automate UI text translation/generation? Claude AI? Other? What is world class amazing performance and accuracy? Specialized service? Principles "5. Global-First" in mind.

Consider graceful language revision to README.md. Remove "dopamine hits".

Greenfield perspective. Are there any stale ADRs, DESs, or PROs?

Greenfield perspective. How do you design and test for "Search quality evaluation — 50-query golden set proving retrieval relevance before anything else is built"? Can be automated with Claude etc?

Think slowly and carefully.
Greenfield perspective. Does the project apply the principles in practice? Consider arc/milestone ordering and all other dimensions. With mobile phone use as primary device for India and Latin America (true?), is mobile support properly ordered?

Greenfield perspective. Choice of project markdown file characteristics (quantity, logical naming, sizing, etc, other). What do you prefer? What would an AI architect, designer, and implementer prefer? You have complete design autonomy.

Think slowly, carefully, and deeply.
Think generatively and imaginatively.
Be proactive.
How might the teachings portal support YSS? Perhaps they could have a design surface for reusing aor developing features they wish to select into YSS. How to empower them to build for their specific audience tastes and needs? Can leveerage the platform features? Develop new ones? How to harmonisouly develop independently, yet share and rely on each other's offerings? We have ADRs, DESs, PROs in support? What have we not asked? What questions would I benefit from asking? What serves YSS?

YSS has an online bookstore https://yssofindia.org/.  The Basic Series of Yogoda Satsanga Lessons is available in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. Consider how we make make parts or whole to support YSS? How would they use the teachings portal for their core audiences? Are there components, APIs, tools that would benefit from? Re-branding is good. Think beyond re-branding. They maintain their organization independently- a sister organization. How can we help serve them?

Prepare to ingest Autobiography of a Yogi in Hindi https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-HINDI-Hindi-Paramahansa-Yogananda/dp/9389432472

Think slowly, deeply and carefully.
Imagine Claude Code develops each milestone and each arc autonomously without human confirmation. Would you be able to implement Arc 1 fully? Arc 2? Arc 3? Others? What are potential blockers to shipping Arc 1? Is AI able to setup all infrastructure autonomously? Do you need AWS MCP server? What, if anything, needs some human setup steps? Let's also explore a infrastructure bootstrap setup and test with a "Hello World" which exercise each piece of the infrastructure. Perhaps a script to create and delete. We could run it per environment for testing prior to development to ensure keys, infrastructure running properly. What's your perspective? It gets us up and running quickly?

Add principle "World-class amazing experience" as high directive for the portal.

Add principle "Global-first" to support all humans of Earth. Equally supports low-resourced peoples and high-resourced peoples. Equally supports low-resource phones with limited and intermittent bandwidth, high-resourced phones with high bandwidth, tablet, and desktop experiences. 
  
Consider Turso DB (https://turso.tech/) use for Global-first and offline support.

Add AWS Secrets Manager support per environment. Largely or wholey replace environment variables. Update related docs mentioning env variables including `docs/manual-steps-milestone-1a.md`

Why didn't you (AI) with the design docs, and existing Claude Code skills/commands (`/home/rana/.claude/`) not surface a Secrets Manager solution? What questions and or explorations may have let to Claude suggesting the solution? Or similar? I often use the `explore-act` command. In retrospect, it seems an obvious choice for the scope and nature of the project.

How to prioritize when each book is scheduled to be added to the portal for each language. Includes determining prioritizing portal languages supported and when. Do we support only languages SRF has translations for? Research Earth demographics for population per language. Research demographics for technology availability for device types and bandwidths ie, phone, phone types, tablet, desktop. This would help prioritize language / book role out. AI research reports with citations (UNESCO, etc).




Rename content_tier to author_tier

Change term Library to Collections. Audio Library -> Audio Collections, etc. 

Fix book I get gaps with manual read of Autobiography of a Yogi 

Elmer. Reverse engineer existing project to spec docs, create project from spec docs, rate delta from created to original. Analyze improvements to Elmer. Repeat until Elmer is capable of reasonable reproduction. Having open source project may be beneficial to compare before and after.

Mine Google Antigravity for Elmer features. Consider it for reverse engineer test case.

Global Equity. Are we doing all that we can to support Global Equity of the underserved?

Image Libray section of all images. Guru images, book images, magazine images with multiple organization design by AI. Use AI image tagging, categorization, summarization etc. Leverage book captions, etc where available.

All books by SRF treated as sacred text. Many authors, not just Yogananda.

Are we using Neon Postgres features and addons/plugins to it's fullest? Wise use > more use. Versioning is one example. What are we not considered? See https://neon.com/docs/llms.txt.

Are we using Contentful to it's fullest and wisely? Wise use > more use. What are we not considering? Survey Contentful features, reference documents, MCP server, etc.

Terraform and CI/CD (GitHub) from day one. What service accounts and keys does a human need to provide? What other considerations? Are we designing for it? Are we using it to it's fullest and wisely? Wise use > more use. What have we not considered?

Elmer to autonomously build, deploy, test, etc project `/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/`. What features would AI prefer to have to enable? What would an ideal experience look like for AI? What context directives would AI prefer to have? And what do we have today? Is it feasible? Are there check points and verifications? What would I benefit from seeing or doing?

Are we using AI and Claude AI to it's fullest and wisely? Wise use > more use. What are we not considered?

Contentful from day one. Srf books are stored in Contentful. Start from PDF of Autobiography of a Yogi. PDF to Contentful. Place all other books in backlog sourced from Contentful. Here is a PDF not requiring OCR (https://files.spiritmaji.com/books/yogananda/Paramahansa%20Yogananda%20-%20Autobiography%20of%20a%20Yogi%20%28281p%29.pdf). It is not an accurate reproduction. It will eventually be replaced with original SRF material.

Create Unscheduled Features section.

Define core set of languages supported: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Thai and Hindi. Remove ADR for Hindi Bengali. Document non-English in Unscheduled Features.

Explore reduced number of phases. Consider a theme for each phase. Unscheduled Features section is available. What is the SRF Online Teachings Portal mission?

Value proposition of introducing identifier notation PRO-NNN (or similar) for Unscheduled Features? Perhaps PRO-NNN can change to ADR or DES?

Ensure mobile is equally supported as desktop.

Verbatim directives for alignment with sacred core mission. Add directive prohibiting AI generated voice, image and video for original Yogananda source materials. Complies with spirit of verbatim sacred transmission of original source material. Determine where to record directive. One ADR for all media types with call outs to each media type? Or? See "Direct Quotes Only", "Sacred Text Fidelity" in `/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/PRINCIPLES.md`. These suggestions are similar to text, but for other media types. Mild adjacent allowances for human book readings (Monastic, Actor, etc), Aria text readers, etc. Additional allowances for non-guru related material. For example, ok to AI generate decorative images to support site user experience. Okay to generate bell chimes for site user experience. Not okay to have AI read sacred texts. Enstrust sacred transmission of words to monastics reading aloud. CRUD ADRs, DESs, PROs to support this change.

Full support for web crawlers (search engines, AI LLMs). In relation to Yogananda's mission, and that of the teachings portal, what do you see for, against, and through for fully supporting web crawlers? I see it fully disseminating the work through the world and creating a discovery vector when people use those tools. When we enable citation it drives traffic to srf teachings portal. Also note that non-authorized copies have already been disseminated and absrobed in search engines and LLMs. LLMs are well aware of Yogananda's work. Better that they have high fidelity source material to work with. One possible drawback and grey area is copyright scenarios. The alternative is some technology wall such as FlipBooks3D or similar, which may impede dissemination across the world, such as mobile phones in rural Bihar, etc for Global Equity. On balance, I lean towards full web crawler dissemination. Read file on copyright stance `/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/.elmer/proposals/clarify-copyright-stance-srf-makes-it-feel-available-to-all.md`.

The SRF Lessons online (https://study.yogananda.org/, https://flipbooks.yogananda.org/) appear to use a book reader technology called  FlipBooks3D. Document it's use. Record that it may be selected for online teachings portal in the backlog.

What themes from the SRF corpus would resonate with each culture? Have cultural theme collections which may have higher affinity with a culture.

Explore how SRF Corpus MCP server may be used by internal autonomous AI Agents. Generatively and imaginitively look for how it may serve the SRF organization. How might a proactive autonomous AI Agent working on behalf of SRF internal stakeholders serve?

Audience Engagement Dashboard of deployments, environments, stats, ability to deploy, rollback. What else would be help operations be smooth, easy, visible and efficient? Overview of all systems deploy and services (Neon, AWS, Sentry, New Relic, etc)? Operational budgets and costs overview. AI monitoring for spikes in costs, and other factors? WHat happends if we change vendors? Easy to add and remove? Redevelop with Calude Code?

Answer open questions.

AI summarization of each image for metadata for use in search, cross reference lookups. Tags + summary description.

Srf visual design language which echoes third eye. Use Yogananda description for guidance. Navy, golden halo rays, etc. include as option in visual design language. Include others. Consider using Figma for assets.

Gather all SRF websites for reference and linking. Srflessons.org, etc.

Proactive AI agent. Further AI automation of editorial duties. AI suggests/generates autonomously, humans approve or decline manually. Additional communication channels: email, MS Teams itegration. People can click link to review, and/or button to approve/decline possibly. Approved items flow into the portal. 

Proactive AI agent. Generate portal feature ideas. Novel features, variation of existing features, etc 

Word graph. Similar to knowledge graph. Graph traversal of SRF corpus by individual words. Allow filter for inclusion and/or exclusion.

Theme: self worth, abundance, scientific view

For constrained resource phones consider offering small images sized for optimal experience. If they visit the gurus image , it defaults to their screen size. 

Clarify copyright stance. Srf makes it feel available to all, including search engines and AI models for reference and citation. Srf still reserved all copyrights. Perhaps have page and endpoint.

Focused reader mode. The reader and the book nothing else . No website distractions, no related teachings, etc. A reading mode to enter into. Optional mouse over paragraph to enter dwell mode or similar. Expand text scale and to foreground. Background blur darkens. Easy reading. Could call it easy reading mode. East read to me mode. Toggle on. Mouse over paragraph reads to me. Can be combined with easy reading mode. Use SRF ux of navy background, have golden halo rays similar to third eye glow around text for dwell/focus of paragraph. Use subtle, gentle experience, timings, etc.

Book read-to-me mode toggle isplayed next to book text. Human reading of the book for illiterate, young people, or anyone. Perhaps option of man or woman. Read by monastics. Have reading in each language. Can start reading from any paragraph, start of book, chapter, etc. Note estimate illiterate, and who it might reach on Earth.

Future self in 10 years would say what about each decision? What if anything would I wish I had done differently in 10 years?

Theme for extra solar life in the cosmos. What do the guru's say about life in the cosmos beyond Earth?

Vibration, aum, holy Ghost, quantum physics overlap for scientific reader

Are we designing, implementing, operating on the highest octaves of expression?

Search bar, auto word suggestions in each language. Intelligent like Google 

Inhabit SRF staff perspectives, including content editors. What apps, workflows, and other considerations would make their life easier?

Modern 2026 UX. Is there UX we can apply to uplift the experience? Make it smoother? Easier? Delightful? More aligned with the spirit of the missions? More serviceful? More proactively helpful? More nuance? More sublime?

Develop autonomous research and autonomous design with branching requiring human approval to merge automated design to main branch. Could copy directory and run Claude Code for each autonomous step. Perhaps way for human to read design proposal and approve. Separate app? Could use with multiple projects. There may be multiple sets of template questions. AI may generate topics to explore and use an appropriate template. A human may provide N topics, AI could explore each topic with a template in an individual fork branch. AI may generate it's own topics without template use as well.

Scan and clean offcenter , unkind terms such as first class, global south, etc. choose more compassionate or neutral terms.

Consider offering the platform as open source on GitHub for other organizations.

Comparative analysis of srf tech stock with ADR decisions. Why and when Neon or DynamoDB? Alternatives researched. 

Consider services for high quality embeddings for supporting all earth languages. That is core to product offering and may justify expense.

Cosmic chants book with side cross links to audio video of chant being read.

Does the People Library include and support monastics? Biography for convocation, lectures, erc? Year birth/passing. Would also be interesting to somewhere have lineage of srf presidents.

New newsletter section may be interesting. Perhaps similar to magazine articles. May also use templates, email, etc.

Perhaps announcements section as well.

Trace through each user workflow for gaps or improvements.

Trace through each use experience for gaps or improvements.

Create skills for common prompts. "You have complete design autonomy."

Capability for anyone in srf staff, monastics to create a section. Could be curated themes with all medias. Could be an article, could be a talk, study profile, etc. what could be done? Useful? How can we empower people to use the platform? The public and srf members could use it to generate there own section. It could be public curated sections of srf content. How do we empower the public? Public curation might be adopted and approved for long term retention or highlighting outside of public curation section. There are many ways to approach with many possibilities.

Usage stats of services. Google analytics as well? How to know who were serving? And where to focus or improve?

Sanskrit. Display and perhaps glossary. Several books are written in Sanskrit. Other considerations?

Automated end user release notes . Perhaps accessible from the portal itself. 

Ability to roll back entire platform release across all services. Entire surface progresses as single step which can rollback. Consider deployment scenarios to enable. Perhaps side by side deployment. 

Portal page. High density text of categories and subcategories. Another approach to navigating the content. Similar to Lib.rs — home for Rust crates // Lib.rs https://share.google/MJnT7jaJINlNYKtjJ. A second similar page may be like Crate List - Blessed.rs https://share.google/ccIMJmC1aWuDk9jRz.

What are novel learning experiences, exploration experiences, organization experiences? Also go beyond historical approaches? What have humans never conceived of? What would you design for an AI audience reading? Consider various scenarios.

Consider WebGL, https://spline.design, and others. What would be of service, if anything? Maybe nothing?

For "Knowledge graph — interactive visual map of the teaching corpus showing cross-book connections, themes, persons, and scriptures" Ensure all medias included (book, articles, videos, audio, etc).

### AWS MCP Server for Claude Code

Yes! There is an official **AWS MCP server** (actually a suite of them). The main ones relevant here:

**`awslabs/aws-documentation-mcp-server`** — searches AWS docs
**`awslabs/cdk-mcp-server`** — helps write AWS CDK infrastructure code
**`awslabs/core-mcp-server`** — orchestrates the other AWS MCP servers

The AWS MCP servers are maintained by AWS Labs on GitHub: `github.com/awslabs/mcp`

**To set up in Claude Code**, add to your `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (or `.claude.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.cdk-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.cdk-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    },
    "awslabs.core-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
