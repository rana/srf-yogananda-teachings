# Scratch Pad

---
The Contentful-from-Day-One proposal (.elmer/proposals/contentful-from-day-one-two-type-content-model-pdf-to-contentful-to-neon.md) makes three commitments that compound over a decade: (1) Contentful becomes a Phase 0 dependency rather than a Phase 9 addition, (2) a two-type content model (Book + Chapter) replaces the existing four-type model (Book/Chapter/Section/TextBlock), and (3) Rich Text body + JSON pageMap becomes the canonical encoding of sacred text between its physical form and its search index.

For each commitment: What does it depend on that isn't stated? What alternative would a thoughtful dissenter propose? What does the maintainer in 2036 wish we had examined? What breaks when the corpus grows from one narrative book to twenty books spanning verse-commentary, chants, affirmations, and dialogues? What simpler intermediate representation between physical book and search index would serve the same goals with fewer moving parts?

Read the proposal against PRINCIPLES.md (especially Principles 2, 8, 10), ADR-010, ADR-048, and the existing Contentful content model in DESIGN-phase0.md (line 1207+). Ground every observation in a specific document section.

## Format

- **Open items:** `- [ ] [P1] Item text → /suggested-skill`
- **Completed items:** `- [x] Item text → outcome note`
- **Priority:** `[P1]` high impact, `[P2]` medium, `[P3]` exploratory
- **Skill hint:** `→ /skill-name` (what `/scratch` would recommend)

## Open Items

### P1 — High Impact

- [ ] [P1] Trace through each user workflow for gaps or improvements → `/workflow-trace seeker reading journey`
- [ ] [P1] Trace through each user experience for gaps or improvements → `/workflow-trace new visitor first encounter`
- [ ] [P1] Ability to roll back entire platform release across all services. Entire surface progresses as single step which can rollback. Consider deployment scenarios. Perhaps side by side deployment → `/ops-review deployment rollback`
- [ ] [P1] Architecture patterns. Review architecture patterns in use and omitted. What patterns benefit us? Do we prefer loosely coupled, and are we applying it if relevant? → `/deep-review architecture patterns`
- [ ] [P1] Is the data model consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? → `/api-review data model`
- [ ] [P1] Is the editorial workflow architecture consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? → `/workflow-trace editorial pipeline`
- [ ] [P1] Is the content pipeline consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? → `/workflow-trace content ingestion pipeline`
- [ ] [P1] Is the MCP architecture consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? → `/api-review MCP architecture`

### P2 — Medium Impact

- [ ] [P2] Consider a site/feature/mechanism for SRF Staff to communicate available open tasks to VLD members for them to complete. Think through workflow of all involved → `/workflow-trace VLD task assignment`
- [ ] [P2] Consider that AI (you) is architect, designer and implementer. Humans are also in the loop. Is it valuable to document that? Or a distraction? → `/docs-quality AI-human collaboration documentation`
- [ ] [P2] Consider a new INFRASTRUCTURE.md or TECH-STACK.md or similarly named document next to existing markdown documents. What is the value proposition, if any? Would it help Claude? → `/docs-quality document structure`
- [ ] [P2] Is the visual design system consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? → `/seeker-ux visual design system`

### P3 — Exploratory

- [ ] [P3] Consider WebGL, https://spline.design, and others. What would be of service, if anything? Maybe nothing? → `/explore-act`
- [ ] [P3] Explore Google Storybook (https://gemini.google.com/gem/storybook). "Create a customized picture book, for either children or adults, given a topic, an optional target audience age, and an optional art style for the images." Provide as documentation of available resource for Lay members, VLD, and SRF staff. Could there be community submission reviewed by VLD/staff and approved for sharing? → `/explore-act`

## Template

```
Deep multi-dimensional perspective.

[INSERT ITEM OF FOCUS]

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

You have complete design autonomy.

If this exploration yields something worth keeping, propose where it belongs in the project documents.
```
