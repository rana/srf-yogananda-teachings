# Manual Prompts

Focus on reading experience. 

How to make it world-class and amazingly accessible to all humans of Earth?

How can we make this a highly serviceful, delightful experience for the reader?

Some ideas.

As reading a paragraph from Autobiography of a Yogi. Show a side panel of related works across whole library. 

Perhaps show top three related reading with option to explore all related? Auto show related readings without user searching. Pre-calculate all related text? What value is there in sentence level embeddings vs paragraph level embeddings? Paragraph level embedding enough?

Is there potential paragraaph (or other unit) user graph traversal of all the readings. If we show related one degree of relation, navigate, then navigate to the next degree of navigation, that may be a novel way to travel the library.

Start with readings, and eventually also transcribe all audio and video. Show related audio/video in side panel as auto-suggestion just as books.

Be pro-active in helping the reader with anything. Search bar is good. Being pro-active in suggesting related is taking the next step.

What features are we not asking about?

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What questions am I not asking?

Search bar background text: "How can I help you?"

- Include an end-to-end test of related text to ensure it is providing high-quality suggestions. The teaching portal is focused quality teaching.

Beyond what we have already defined.

What would make the reading experience world-class and amazingly accessible?

What innovate concepts might we consider?

What simple touches would uplift the heart?

Consider SRF website imagery?

Would you like to see, intuit, explore, design, build, or anything while that happens?

Be pro-active (that's why OpenClaw may work well).
Remember you have vast capability, intelligence and agency. 

You have complete design autonomy.
---

What do you think of:

When a version of the teaching portal is released three types of summaries of the whole site may be produced for stakeholders.

It could be executive summary of whole site. Include high level features, approaches, and so on. Have a high-level, medium-level, and detailed-level equivcalent document for different audiences. Produce these documents for each release.

You have complete design autonomy.

Make snapshots of SRF 
- mobile app for members for ideas.
- member's portal for ideas

---

Reflect through markdown documents looking for coherence and alignment. I'm preparing for eventual implementation. 

What would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

Would you simplify anything?

Would you remove anything?

Is the design crystalline?

What are you not enthusiastic about?

Do all our designs support multilingual? That is core to supporting Earth's population.

For example, REST API suport multilingual design as needed?

Embedding cross-reference to same langauge only?

Other questions to ask which we benefit from?

When I'm reading I may wish to share:
- Via email, download, social media (eventually)
- Format text or PDF
- Text may provide url to origin and short title
- PDF may contain more book like feel
- May share paragraph, chapter, whole book
- May use SRF lotuc branding (Similar to photo watermark)

Let's thoroughly think through sharing of each medium starting with email.

-
Dwell feature for web. How about mouse over paragraph for 5s starts dwell effect? Mouse move/click releases dwell effect?


-
How are we serving Earth humans?
- Consider people with little means?
- Consider perspectives of each Earth culture? Are we providing sufficient cultural enagement, perspective shift, and what else?
- Can rural minimal infrastructure people have a good experience? How can we better serve their needs?
- What am I blind to thus far? I am an American software engineer in California with limited perspective. How would you ensure we are serving all of Earth?

1. Let's think through deploying the whole app release from GitHub. How would we approach it? We consider terraform. Is that appropriate to interface to all services. Consider we may eventually have multiple environments. Migration to GitLab may occur.

2. How are "Related Teachings" distinct from "Continue the Thread"?

3. Consider the entire stack for cost optimization. Would using AWS services benefit us at all. Consider Lambdas, teh stated SRF tech stack. Be open to alternatives when there is a compelling value proposition.

4. Let's deeply consider the Global South. Have we done everything to serve them?

5. Let's explore design for mobile apps (Android, iOS, etc?). We can prioritize towards end phases. The sooner we design for, the better?

What questions am I not asking?

What would serve our mission well?

Are there any improvements to the reading experience?

How coherent and resonant are our markdown documents? Look at another projects markdown documents (`/home/rana/prj/mercury/`) for comparison and ideas.

Look at the current project's markdown documents from a lense of a greenfield project. Would you adjust anything? No adjustments is just fine too.

1. Look at the whole project from an operational point fo view. Are there gaps in our design? What are the operational costs? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

2. Is there value in re-number the ADRs to sequential based on reading for your benefit? Currently they are number based on historical creation time. What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

3. Are the markdown documents coherent? Are there obsolete info? Are there incorrect associations? Labels? Do the diagrams in DESIGN.md need revisions? Are the diagram endpoints still valid? Do the diagrams have ommissions? Would you use as is? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

4. What are the blind spots? Trace through each phase? Trace through operations through architecture. What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

5. Inhabit the heart and mind of each of the cultures: spanish, german, french, italian, portuguese, english, japanese, hindi, bengali. What are we doing, if anything, doesn't make sense from that cultural lense? How can we serve each culture as best as possible? What are our blind spots? What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

6. Expand list of REST endpoints? Evaluate adding REST endpoints:
- `/v1/places/[slug]`
- `/v1/people/[slug]`
- `/v1/explore(or theme, or similar)/[courage|etc]` for ADR-013: Teaching Topics — Curated Thematic Entry Points

What other REST endpoints might be helpful?

And, what value or convenience, if any, would each endpoint provide? Is this a solution looking for a problem? Or an elegant expansion serving the mission?

What am I not asking? You have complete design autonomy.

Look through the existing markdown documents. 

Mine for unseen opportunities. 

Do a deep, multi-dimensional perspective.

---
Read through the existing markdown documents (CONTEXT.md, DESIGN.md, 
ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md).

Identify opportunities I may be missing: architectural simplifications, 
underexploited capabilities, strategic gaps, decisions that should be 
revisited given current state, or phase transitions that could be 
accelerated.

Be proactive — propose concrete actions, not just observations.

I'm preparing for implementation.

AI is architect. AI is implementer.

Deep multi-dimensional scan for coherence.

Are there errors, gaps, mis-references, omissions, etc (if any)?

Be proactive — propose concrete actions, not just observations.

Would you use as is? Push back as needed. No changes is equally appropriate.

Look through the existing markdown documents. 

AI uses the documents to design and implement.

Examine documentation protocols, conventions, structures, files, and all other relevant areas.

What do you see for, against, and through our documentation practices?

Look for areas of improvement.

Look for novel approaches and practices.

Would you add, edit, or remove anything for the improve documentation communication.

#	Idea
✅ 1	Consider services for high quality embeddings for supporting all earth languages. That is core to product offering and may justify expense.

✅ 2	Search bar, auto word suggestions in each language. Intelligent like Google

✅ 3	Are we designing, implementing, operating on the highest octaves of expression?

✅ 4	Modern 2026 UX. Is there UX we can apply to uplift the experience? Make it smoother? Easier? Delightful? More aligned with the spirit of the missions? More serviceful? More proactively helpful? More nuance? More sublime?

✅ 5	What are novel learning experiences, exploration experiences, organization experiences? Also go beyond historical approaches? What have humans never conceived of? What would you design for an AI audience reading? Consider various scenarios.

✅ 6	Capability for anyone in srf staff, monastics, lay members, open public people to create a section. Could be curated themes with all medias. Could be an article, could be a talk, study profile, etc. what could be done? Useful? How can we empower people to use the platform? The public and srf members could use it to generate there own section. It could be public curated sections of srf content. How do we empower the public? Public curation might be adopted and approved for long term retention or highlighting outside of public curation section. There are many ways to approach with many possibilities.

✅ 7	For "Knowledge graph — interactive visual map of the teaching corpus showing cross-book connections, themes, persons, and scriptures" Ensure all medias included (book, articles, videos, audio, etc).

✅ 8	Portal page. High density text of categories and subcategories. Another approach to navigating the content. Similar to https://lib.rs. A second similar page may also be created like https://blessed.rs. Consider if not duplicative. Perhaps also helpful for text-only mode for low bandwidth devices.

✅ 9	Cosmic chants book with side cross links to audio video of chant being read.

✅ 10	Sanskrit. Display and perhaps glossary. Several books are written in Sanskrit. Sanskrit has a role in the cultural origins of India inlcuding the books Bhagavad Gita, The Holy Science. Spiritual root language used often and transliterated in English with common uses (karma, etc). Other considerations?

✅ 11	Does the People Library include and support monastics? Biography for convocation, lectures, etc? In memorium year birth/passing. Also, lineage of srf presidents is available in Santa Rosa meditation group. Something similar somewhere in the portal would also be nice.

✅ 12	Inhabit SRF staff perspectives, including content editors. What apps, workflows, and other considerations would make their life easier? Include a way to enter corpus material. Consider requests for new content, approval of new content, publishing of new content. What other dimensions to consider? Consider the same for portal feature requests, approval/decline/decision recording. Survey all potential personas for the creation and maintenance of the portal for SRF organizational purposes. Consider AI automation with human-in-the-loop editing and approval for potentially automatable tasks. For example, UI copy could be generated by AI with top N choices default to top single choice. Human can edit, accept, decline. Incorporating that into as much administrative work in a respectful, mission-guided, ethical, reverant way may be a time-saver for limited quantity of staff. Also consider that there is the Volunteary League of Disciples (VLD) available to delegate work to. Inhabit Volunteary League of Disciples perspectives. How can we empower VLD members to easily assist?

13	Trace through each user workflow for gaps or improvements.

14	Trace through each user experience for gaps or improvements.

✅ 15	Scan and clean off-center, unkind terms such as first-class, global south, etc. Choose compassionate or neutral terms.

16	Ability to roll back entire platform release across all services. Entire surface progresses as single step which can rollback. Consider deployment scenarios to enable. Perhaps side by side deployment.

✅ 17	Usage stats of services. Google analytics as well? How to know who were serving? And where to focus or improve? Useful for executive reports, operations awareness, etc. → Explored. Google Analytics rejected (DELTA-incompatible). Added: `requested_language` + `zero_results` to Amplitude schema, Standing Operational Metrics table in DES-037, Google Search Console evaluation + AI cost alerting + observability cost budget + dashboard cadence questions to CONTEXT.md, standing geographic monitors to Phase 7.7, content availability matrix + unmet language demand to Phase 11.14.

✅ 18	Explore developing autonomous research and autonomous design with branching requiring human approval to merge automated design to main branch. Include option to auto-approve. Could copy directory and run Claude Code for each autonomous step. Perhaps way for human to read design proposal and approve. Separate app? Could use with multiple projects. There may be multiple sets of template questions. AI may generate topics to explore and use an appropriate template. A human may provide N topics, AI could explore each topic with a template in an individual fork branch. AI may generate it's own topics without template use as well. 

Potential template may be:
```
Deep multi-dimensional perspective — biased toward action.

Read CONTEXT.md, DESIGN.md, DECISIONS.md, and ROADMAP.md first to ground your exploration in the project's actual state.

[INSERT ITEM OF FOCUS]

Be proactive — propose concrete actions, not just observations. For every insight, answer:
1. What specific change would this imply? (code, design, decision, or document)
2. Where exactly does it belong? (file, section, Identifier number, ADR, etc)
3. What's the next step to act on it?

What questions would I benefit from asking?

```
Use Claude Code Plugin Ralph Wiggum as example (`https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum`).

Would a Claude Code Plugin be appropriate? Another form of running the code?


✅ 19	Automated end user release notes when portal is released and deployed. Perhaps accessible from the portal itself. Menu options to see what's new. Perhaps use AI to summarize and/or list features. Automation is helpful. Could have a historical list of feature improvements? Could also be included in news section.


✅ 22	Comparative analysis of srf tech stack (`docs/reference/SRF Tech Stack Brief-3.md`) with ADR decisions. Why and when Neon or DynamoDB? Alternatives researched. Would we be served by shifting emphasis to DynamoDB use? Other services? What candidate services to survey and consider?

✅ 23	Create skills for common prompts. "You have complete design autonomy."

24	Consider WebGL, https://spline.design, and others. What would be of service, if anything? Maybe nothing?

✅ 26	Global privacy compliance. GPDR, Europe, Germany, etc. Are we in compliance? How can we demonstrate compliance for internal and external audiences?

✅ 27	Device form factor support. Are we designing for mobile, tablets, desktop and possible others?

✅ 28	Phase sizing and organization. Are phases right-sized? Would you segment or combine any phases for a greenfield project? Would you re-order any phases. Greenfield perspective.

✅ 30	Survey potential personas for the use of the portal. Have we already cover this thoroughly?

✅ 31	Consider UX needs based on spirtual path (new, studying, vetran of 20+ years). Or duration of portal use. Offering an optional account may open features beyond local storage?

32	Explore Google Storybook (https://gemini.google.com/gem/storybook). "Create a customized picture book, for either children or adults, given a topic, an optional target audience age, and an optional art style for the images." Provide as documentation of available resource for Lay members, Volunteary League of Disciples, and SRF staff. Suppose a Lay member creates a truly sweet and memorable children's book for their daughter and would like to share it with the community. Could there be a community submission which is reviewed VLD/staff and approved for community sharing?

✅ 33	Inter-faith/spiritual/agnostic/athiest perspectives. Inhabit each perspective. Consider a section/page/theme/experience/thread/curation/etc for each. What are high resonating approaches that might interest each perspective? What are the affinities?

✅ 34	What wants to emerge?

✅ 35	Age-centric section/page/theme/experience/thread/curation/etc. What do we have? What would serve?

✅ 36	What cultural in-sensitivity and biases may be present? How are we being coherent for each culture? Are there actionable improvements?

✅ 37	How clear, coherent, explicit is the "verbatim" directives for the master's words? High-fidelity is extremly high on the mission agenda.

38	Consider that AI (you) is architected, designer and implementer. Humans are also in the loop. Is it valuable to document that? Or a distraction?

39	Consider a new INFRASTRUCTURE.md or TECH-STACK.md or similarly named document next to existing markdown documents. What is the value proposition, if any? Would it help you at all?

40	Consider a site/feature/mechanism for SRF Staff to communicate available open tasks to VLD members for them to complete. Think through workflow of all involved.

✅ 41	Consider adding a public overview of kriya yoga teachings and SRF Lessons. These allow public to understand what it is and what is entailed to enroll. Perhaps there is also a kriya theme or section.

✅ 42 MCP. Does SRF Portal MCP adequately capture portal offerings? For example, Knowledge Graph? Others? Imagine scenarios where AI is generating aggregate based on statemetns or question using MCP to return verbatim content.

43 Architecture patterns. Review architecture patterns in use and omitted. What patterns benefit us? Do we prefer loosly coupled, and are we apply it if relevant?

✅ 44 Are we servicing search engines, web crawlers, LLM bots to the fullest extent?

✅ 45 Is the API design surface consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?

Is the data model consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?

Is the visual design system consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?

Is the editorial workflow architecture consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?

Is the content pipeline consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?

Is the MCP architecture consistent and well-reasoned? Do I explain design and reasons why sufficiently? Can we ask that of other aspects of the portal?
