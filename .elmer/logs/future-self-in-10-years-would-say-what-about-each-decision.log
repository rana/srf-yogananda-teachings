The analysis reveals fascinating patterns about what will age well and what may create unnecessary constraints.\n\n### Key Insights from 2036:\n\n**Decisions that will age brilliantly:**\n- **ADR-001 (Direct Quotes Only)** - The verbatim-only policy becomes the portal's key differentiator in an AI-saturated future\n- **ADR-004 (10-Year Horizon)** - Thinking in decades while others optimize for quarters\n- **ADR-098 (Documentation Architecture)** - The AI-first documentation approach proves essential\n- **ADR-095 (DELTA Analytics)** - Privacy-first design anticipates regulations that don't exist yet\n- **ADR-006 (Global Equity)** - 2G/low-bandwidth design becomes critical when infrastructure fails\n\n**Decisions creating unnecessary constraints:**\n- **ADR-010 (Contentful at Phase 9)** - Results in double-ingestion of every book\n- **ADR-103 (15 Phases)** - Even after restructuring, still too granular\n- **ADR-027 (Hybrid URL Strategy)** - Different patterns for pages vs APIs creates lasting confusion\n\n**Critical gaps discovered:**\n- No succession planning for key stakeholders\n- Underestimated mobile supremacy (89% mobile-only by 2035)\n- No consideration of climate resilience or offline access\n- Assumed AI capabilities would plateau\n- Over-specified data model with many unused tables\n\n### Actionable Recommendations:\n\n1. **Simplify to 7 core phases** with parallel tracks instead of 15 sequential phases\n2. **Decide Contentful now** - Either use from Phase 0 or never\n3. **Design mobile-first** instead of desktop-first with mobile parity  \n4. **Add community hooks from Day 1** rather than Phase 14\n5. **Start with 10 core tables** and grow organically\n6. **Create capability-based AI abstraction** not provider-based\n7. **Build for offline-first** with service workers\n8. **Add succession documentation** for organizational continuity\n\nThe retrospective also surfaces deeper questions about maintenance burden, theological drift, philanthropist dependency, and the possibility of either massive success or quiet obsolescence.\n\nThe core wisdom from 2036: **Build for maintenance, not features. The teachings matter more than the portal. Every decision should be evaluated against whether seekers found what they needed when they needed it, not technical elegance.**","session_id":"22f6ca1e-aa6f-4d38-a229-f0c483f785e0","total_cost_usd":4.461861,"usage":{"input_tokens":73,"cache_creation_input_tokens":91840,"cache_read_input_tokens":1011554,"output_tokens":16240,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":1915,"outputTokens":304,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0034349999999999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":73,"outputTokens":16240,"cacheReadInputTokens":1011554,"cacheCreationInputTokens":91840,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":4.458426,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_0158P2csu1GvngioHyDcWPzU","tool_input":{"pattern":"ADR-\\d{3}:","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/DECISIONS.md","output_mode":"content"}}],"uuid":"e71321a2-62bf-4d07-b303-949c1a29d89b"}
