{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":234812,"duration_api_ms":233741,"num_turns":8,"result":"I've completed a deep exploration of how Yogananda's teachings on vibration, AUM, and the Holy Ghost intersect with quantum physics concepts, focusing on actionable ways to serve scientifically-minded seekers.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nYogananda was remarkably prescient in using scientific metaphors decades before quantum physics popularized similar concepts. He described the universe as \"cosmic vibration,\" spoke of \"lifetrons,\" and explained the Holy Ghost as \"intelligent cosmic energy\" — all paralleling modern quantum field theory and wave-particle duality.\n\n## Critical Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. **Science-Spirit Terminology Bridge** (Immediate, Phase 0b)\nExtend the spiritual terminology mapping to include quantum physics vocabulary → Yogananda's terms. This enables scientists to find relevant passages using familiar language like \"quantum field\" → \"cosmic vibration.\"\n\n### 2. **\"Science of Spirit\" Theme Category** (Phase 4)\nCreate a dedicated theme category with topics like \"Cosmic Vibration & Quantum Fields\" and \"Maya & Observer Effect\" to make these connections explicitly discoverable.\n\n### 3. **Science Worldview Pathway** (Phase 4)\nDesign a `/guide/science-consciousness/` journey specifically for physicists and researchers, with sections on vibratory universe, consciousness-matter interaction, and dimensional teachings.\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Search Classification** (Phase 0b)\nAdd \"scientific\" intent detection to route queries like \"quantum consciousness\" to passages where Yogananda uses physics metaphors.\n\n### 5. **Knowledge Graph Science Edges** (Phase 4+)\nCreate relationship types like `PARALLELS_PHYSICS_CONCEPT` to enable graph-based discovery across scientific and spiritual domains.\n\n## What You're Not Asking\n\n**The bidirectional bridge:** Should the portal also explain quantum physics to traditional devotees through spiritual metaphors? This could deepen understanding for all seekers.\n\n**The reductionism trap:** Mapping spiritual concepts to physics risks reducing the transcendent to the material. The portal needs to preserve mystery while building bridges.\n\n**Yogananda as empiricist:** He taught Kriya Yoga as a reproducible \"scientific\" method for spiritual experience. Should the portal explicitly frame meditation as empirical methodology for consciousness research?\n\n## Next Immediate Step\n\nUpdate `/lib/data/spiritual-terms.json` with an initial set of 20-30 quantum physics → Yogananda terminology mappings. This requires no schema changes and immediately improves search for scientific seekers.\n\nThe proposal maintains the \"librarian not oracle\" principle while creating powerful discovery pathways for those approaching spirituality through the lens of modern physics.","session_id":"4828f071-a0f1-44a5-90cf-b95594b7a429","total_cost_usd":2.23700525,"usage":{"input_tokens":30,"cache_creation_input_tokens":78261,"cache_read_input_tokens":348561,"output_tokens":3273,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":280,"outputTokens":113,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0008449999999999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":30,"outputTokens":3273,"cacheReadInputTokens":348561,"cacheCreationInputTokens":78261,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.23616025,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"97a3acae-4fad-4f6a-bbe4-d205997383a5"}
