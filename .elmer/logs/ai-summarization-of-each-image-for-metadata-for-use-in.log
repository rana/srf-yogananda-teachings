{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":365596,"duration_api_ms":361426,"num_turns":12,"result":"I've completed a thorough exploration of AI image summarization for the SRF Online Teachings Portal and written a comprehensive proposal to `PROPOSAL.md`. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Summary of Proposed Approach\n\nThe portal already has a solid foundation for images as first-class content (ADR-035) with an `image_descriptions` table ready for embeddings. What's needed is a systematic pipeline to generate searchable descriptions and structured tags, following the portal's established \"AI proposes, humans approve\" principle.\n\n## Key Proposed Changes\n\n1. **Image Enrichment Pipeline** - AI generates rich descriptions (100-200 words) and structured tags (subjects, themes, objects, settings, moods) for each image\n\n2. **Sacred Content Handling** - Special reverence for `is_yogananda_subject` images with appropriate prompt design\n\n3. **Database Extensions** - Add `image_tags` table and enrichment status tracking\n\n4. **Editorial Review Integration** - Extend Phase 4 editorial portal with image metadata review queue\n\n5. **Search Integration** - Images appear in \"Related content\" below passages, never displacing text\n\n6. **Faceted Browsing** - Tag-based filtering in image gallery\n\n7. **Cross-Media Connections** - Surface relevant images alongside passages and themes\n\n8. **Privacy Compliance** - Process locally, store only metadata, apply watermarking\n\n## Critical Insights Not Initially Obvious\n\n1. **Visual presence cannot be fully encoded in text** - Photographs of realized masters convey spiritual presence that descriptions cannot capture\n\n2. **Temporal sensitivity** - Yogananda's appearance changes over decades; presentation should be thoughtful about early vs. late photographs\n\n3. **Devotional vs. documentary modes** - Some images are altar photographs for worship, others are historical documentation\n\n4. **Cross-tradition care needed** - Images of Christ, Krishna, and other deities require exceptional sensitivity\n\n5. **The archive's gaps tell a story** - What wasn't photographed reveals priorities of the era\n\nThe proposal is now ready for review and refinement. It provides concrete implementation paths while raising important questions about how to honor the sacred nature of the photographic archive.","session_id":"de538877-c43c-44ac-b4ff-5e4355d65956","total_cost_usd":3.4096935,"usage":{"input_tokens":45,"cache_creation_input_tokens":100180,"cache_read_input_tokens":721169,"output_tokens":5977,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":280,"outputTokens":67,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.000615,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":45,"outputTokens":5977,"cacheReadInputTokens":721169,"cacheCreationInputTokens":100180,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.4090785,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_01RUXCZRR2wZnSgP3ZHSAfQd","tool_input":{"pattern":"image|Image|IMG|Photo|photo|Picture","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings","glob":"*.md","output_mode":"files_with_matches"}}],"uuid":"4f55018e-46e0-462c-9c0a-5aba3bb6eb3b"}
