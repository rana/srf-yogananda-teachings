{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":274259,"duration_api_ms":268756,"num_turns":11,"result":"I've completed my exploration of the theme of extraterrestrial and cosmic life in Yogananda's teachings. The complete proposal has been written to PROPOSAL.md at the specified path.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nParamahansa Yogananda explicitly taught about life beyond Earth, particularly in Chapter 43 of *Autobiography of a Yogi* where he describes detailed conversations with Sri Yukteswar about astral worlds and their inhabitants. However, the current SRF portal design doesn't adequately surface these profound cosmological teachings.\n\nThe proposal identifies seven specific changes to make these teachings discoverable:\n\n1. **Theme taxonomy additions** for \"Life Beyond Earth,\" \"Astral Worlds,\" and related concepts\n2. **Knowledge graph connections** linking cosmic consciousness to extraterrestrial themes\n3. **Search enrichment** to recognize contemporary terminology (UFOs, aliens, multiverse)  \n4. **Curated collection page** organizing these teachings coherently\n5. **New worldview pathway** for \"Cosmos Explorers\"\n6. **Vocabulary bridges** mapping modern space concepts to Yogananda's terminology\n7. **Content metadata enrichment** to tag passages by cosmic scope\n\nThe proposal also identifies critical blind spots — these aren't fringe teachings but central to Yogananda's cosmology. In an era of mainstream UAP disclosure and exoplanet discovery, positioning these teachings properly could demonstrate Yogananda's prescience while comforting seekers who feel alone in the universe.","session_id":"ad7eeacd-ba2f-464c-b687-5cd7c34df949","total_cost_usd":2.3407080000000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":52,"cache_creation_input_tokens":66244,"cache_read_input_tokens":526052,"output_tokens":4117,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":52,"outputTokens":4117,"cacheReadInputTokens":526052,"cacheCreationInputTokens":66244,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.3407080000000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"7a3b9f67-e140-4e77-9224-44e5fd359c4a"}
