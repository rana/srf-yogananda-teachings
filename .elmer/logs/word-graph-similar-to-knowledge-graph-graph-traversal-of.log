The PROPOSAL.md file has been successfully created with a comprehensive word graph enhancement proposal. The proposal includes:\n\n## Key Elements of the Proposal\n\n1. **Summary** - Clear overview of enhancing the Knowledge Graph with word-level traversal capabilities\n\n2. **Analysis** - Detailed examination of the current architecture showing how the word graph complements existing features (Knowledge Graph, Concept/Word Graph, search suggestions, etc.)\n\n3. **Seeker Value Propositions** - Three concrete use cases showing how seekers would benefit:\n   - Vocabulary Explorer (discovering spiritual meanings in common words)\n   - Language Learner (Sanskrit-English contextual bridge)\n   - Pattern Seeker (exploring metaphorical frameworks)\n\n4. **Proposed Changes** - 11 specific implementation areas:\n   - Word Graph Data Model Extension (new tables and schema)\n   - Construction Pipeline (integrated with content ingestion)\n   - Traversal API (new endpoints for word exploration)\n   - Inclusion/Exclusion Filters (advanced filtering system)\n   - UI Components (visualization and navigation)\n   - Search Integration (augmenting existing search)\n   - Word-Concept Bridge (connecting linguistic and conceptual graphs)\n   - Multilingual Mapping (cross-language word relationships)\n   - Performance Optimization (materialized views and caching)\n   - Phased Implementation (aligned with existing roadmap)\n   - ADR Addition (governance documentation)\n\n5. **Open Questions** - Technical, editorial, and UX considerations that need resolution\n\n6. **What's Not Being Asked** - Deeper implications including:\n   - Linguistic assumptions for multilingual content\n   - Temporal semantic drift in vocabulary\n   - Sacred word treatment\n   - Graph complexity management\n   - Pedagogical ordering\n   - Statistical vs. spiritual significance\n   - Distinction from full-text search\n   - Computational linguistics vs. theological interpretation\n\n## Key Insights\n\nThe proposal recognizes that:\n- The word graph reveals patterns in Yogananda's vocabulary that concept-based navigation misses\n- It builds on existing infrastructure (Neptune Analytics, entity registry, search suggestions)\n- It honors ADR-001 by exploring actual words used, never generating content\n- Implementation can be phased across existing roadmap milestones\n- Statistical co-occurrence may not equal spiritual significance\n\nThe proposal is actionable, grounded in the existing architecture, and provides clear value to seekers exploring Yogananda's teachings through the lens of his distinctive vocabulary.","session_id":"65a46bc3-52f6-496a-9bcb-5a66347ff693","total_cost_usd":5.768588249999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":80,"cache_creation_input_tokens":101365,"cache_read_input_tokens":1974019,"output_tokens":12039,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":80,"outputTokens":12039,"cacheReadInputTokens":1974019,"cacheCreationInputTokens":101365,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.765747249999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":2176,"outputTokens":133,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.002841,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_01UiwNJ18pxna2zEQKXhZHHy","tool_input":{"pattern":"knowledge graph|Knowledge Graph","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings","output_mode":"files_with_matches"}},{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_01GLp4xxPf1vGDPW66BsDDMJ","tool_input":{"pattern":"knowledge graph|Knowledge Graph","path":".","output_mode":"files_with_matches"}}],"uuid":"fa83402b-95d1-4515-ba00-5bd1ed634b41"}
