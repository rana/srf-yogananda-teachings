I've successfully created a comprehensive proposal for image optimization for constrained-resource phones. The PROPOSAL.md file now contains:\n\n## Summary\nThe proposal outlines a complete responsive image delivery system that goes beyond basic optimization to include network-aware adaptation, special handling for sacred images (particularly the Guru's photos), and specific optimizations for devices like JioPhones on 2G networks.\n\n## Key Proposed Changes\n1. **Adaptive Image Service** - Automatic selection based on device/network signals\n2. **Dynamic Transformation Pipeline** - On-demand sizing via Lambda@Edge\n3. **Guru Image Special Handling** - Sacred images default to screen-optimal sizes\n4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Multi-layer loading from blur to full quality\n5. **Network-Aware Quality** - Automatic quality adjustment per connection speed\n6. **Client Hints Integration** - Browser-provided optimization signals\n7. **AVIF Format Support** - 30% smaller than WebP for bandwidth savings\n8. **Sacred Image Viewport Optimization** - Screen-fitted defaults for Guru photos\n9. **Bandwidth Estimation** - Fallback when Network Information API unavailable\n10. **Save-Data Mode** - Explicit user preference for data conservation\n11. **Regional CDN Optimization** - Geographic edge routing\n12. **JioPhone-Specific Optimizations** - KaiOS browser detection and adaptation\n\n## Important Considerations\nThe proposal addresses both technical optimization and the spiritual dimension of sacred image viewing, acknowledging that viewing Yogananda's photograph is darshan (sacred viewing), not just information consumption. It balances the need for accessibility on constrained devices with maintaining the dignity and beauty of sacred images.\n\nThe file has been successfully written to disk at `/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/PROPOSAL.md`.","session_id":"51745a05-72b7-4363-855a-0b129ed0c4c3","total_cost_usd":5.282626749999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":124,"cache_creation_input_tokens":72491,"cache_read_input_tokens":1938873,"output_tokens":13333,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":10771,"outputTokens":501,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.013275999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":124,"outputTokens":13333,"cacheReadInputTokens":1938873,"cacheCreationInputTokens":72491,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.26935075,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_01PEadXthphj3ZGGjX9NT2dk","tool_input":{"pattern":"image|Image|IMAGE|photo|Photo|sacred|Sacred|JioPhone|constrained|responsive","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings","glob":"**/*.md","output_mode":"files_with_matches"}},{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_0166CotGUTVTvax4NAyT2rob","tool_input":{"pattern":"ADR-035|ADR-063|ADR-064|image serving|responsive design|DES-049","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/DESIGN.md","output_mode":"content","-B":2,"-A":5}}],"uuid":"9f4aa197-5cea-4398-8e4f-7a635c4b715d"}
