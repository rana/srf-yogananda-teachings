{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":521914,"duration_api_ms":518557,"num_turns":9,"result":"I've completed my exploration of novel portal features for the SRF Online Teachings Portal and written a comprehensive proposal to `PROPOSAL.md`. \n\n## Key Highlights\n\nI've proposed **12 novel features** that extend beyond standard digital library functionality while respecting the portal's sacred text fidelity and calm technology principles:\n\n1. **Passage Resonance Patterns** - Detecting structural echoes and rhetorical patterns across Yogananda's works\n2. **Contemplative Reading Rhythm** - Breathing pauses between chapters \n3. **Seasonal Teachings Intelligence** - Historical teaching calendar\n4. **Sanskrit Pronunciation Guide** - Audio from monastics\n5. **Passage Difficulty Gradient** - Conceptual complexity indicators\n6. **Reading Thread Memory** - Privacy-respecting journey tracking\n7. **Question Seeds** - Curated profound queries from seekers\n8. **Guru Invocation Mode** - Traditional opening ceremony\n9. **Chant-Passage Synchronization** - Text-audio alignment\n10. **Practice Commitment Support** - Gentle accountability without surveillance\n11. **Living Pilgrimage Maps** - Guided digital pilgrimages with historical layers\n12. **Semantic Passage Diff** - Teaching evolution across editions\n\nEach proposal includes:\n- Specific implementation details\n- Exact location in the architecture (tables, endpoints, UI components)\n- Phase assignment aligned with the roadmap\n- Concrete next steps\n\n## Critical Insights\n\nThe exploration also uncovered several **blind spots** in the current design:\n\n- **Western individual-reader bias** - Missing communal reading features important to Indian, African, and Latin American traditions\n- **Monastic voice gap** - No living interpretation alongside historical text\n- **Integration debt** - The portal will be SRF's most advanced property but treats others as external links\n- **Silence features** - The portal helps find teachings but not silence itself\n- **Physical-digital bridge** - No connection between physical temples and digital content\n\nThese proposals honor the portal's foundational constraints (ADR-001: Direct Quotes Only, DELTA framework, Calm Technology) while pushing the boundaries of what a spiritual digital library can be. They transform constraints into creative opportunities - the verbatim requirement enables unique features like passage echo detection that would be impossible with AI synthesis.\n\nThe features range from immediate enhancements (Phase 0b enrichment) to transformative capabilities requiring organizational commitment (Phase 4+ with monastic recordings). Each maintains the portal's identity as a librarian, not an oracle, while creating contemplative digital experiences unique to Yogananda's teachings.","session_id":"154bcbb7-f7e7-4b6b-a47b-df026cf5a5a1","total_cost_usd":2.9703609999999996,"usage":{"input_tokens":36,"cache_creation_input_tokens":91198,"cache_read_input_tokens":446709,"output_tokens":7857,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":280,"outputTokens":48,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.00052,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":36,"outputTokens":7857,"cacheReadInputTokens":446709,"cacheCreationInputTokens":91198,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.9698409999999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"7c407aa5-f56f-4deb-947f-adc5a1f24a3e"}
