{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":442113,"duration_api_ms":441546,"num_turns":12,"result":"I've completed my exploration of the copyright stance for the SRF teachings portal and written a comprehensive proposal to PROPOSAL.md.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe portal has a fundamental tension: making Yogananda's teachings \"freely available throughout the world\" (the philanthropist's vision) while SRF retains copyright (organizational necessity). The current documentation enthusiastically welcomes AI crawlers and search engines but lacks a unified copyright position.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposal establishes that **\"available\" does not mean \"public domain\"**. Content can be freely accessible for reading, reference, and citation while remaining under copyright — just as libraries make copyrighted books available for reading without transferring ownership.\n\nThe key proposed changes include:\n\n1. **Human-readable legal page** (`/legal`) with clear copyright notice and usage guidelines\n2. **Machine-readable endpoint** (`/copyright.json`) for automated systems \n3. **Enhanced llms.txt** with explicit copyright declarations for AI systems\n4. **HTTP headers** carrying copyright metadata with API responses\n5. **Copyright notices** on content displays (unobtrusive but present)\n6. **Sharing guidelines** to empower proper attribution\n7. **Formal AI training permissions** in ADR-081\n\n## Theological Alignment\n\nThe proposal frames copyright retention as **protecting the teachings' integrity**, not restricting their reach. Attribution requirements ensure Yogananda's words remain unaltered and properly credited — serving the spiritual purpose of authentic transmission.\n\n## What's Not Being Addressed\n\nThe proposal identifies several blind spots:\n- Focus on attribution over monetization (which may not align with traditional organizational copyright concerns)\n- No competitive moats or exclusive access\n- Single global stance rather than jurisdiction-specific policies\n- Unclear boundaries between sharing and derivative works\n\nThe complete proposal has been written to PROPOSAL.md with detailed implementation steps for each component.","session_id":"beb359de-dd9b-4344-87fc-609d6eb13e80","total_cost_usd":2.66374325,"usage":{"input_tokens":64,"cache_creation_input_tokens":50783,"cache_read_input_tokens":765124,"output_tokens":7481,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":611,"outputTokens":246,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0018410000000000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":64,"outputTokens":7481,"cacheReadInputTokens":765124,"cacheCreationInputTokens":50783,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.66190225,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Grep","tool_use_id":"toolu_bdrk_01VAXjNpe4BSmvSsEoA2v3qc","tool_input":{"pattern":"copyright|intellectual property|licensing|rights","path":"/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings","glob":"*.md","output_mode":"content","-C":2}}],"uuid":"4b9de9c1-189d-498e-949b-c1f39bcd1941"}
