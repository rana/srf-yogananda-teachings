Here are the key highlights:\n\n## **Impact: Reaching 771 Million+ Excluded Seekers**\n\nThe proposal addresses a massive accessibility gap:\n- **771 million illiterate adults** globally (UNESCO 2022)\n- **287 million in India alone** (the world's largest illiterate population)\n- **295 million with vision impairments**\n- **Millions of children, elderly, dyslexic, and auditory learners**\n\n## **Core Design: Human Voice, Not AI**\n\nThe feature centers on:\n- **Monastic narration** (not text-to-speech) preserving the devotional quality\n- **Gender choice** (male/female voices) respecting cultural preferences\n- **Per-language recordings** (not dubbed) maintaining authenticity\n- **Paragraph-level control** allowing precise navigation\n\n## **Key Architectural Changes Proposed**\n\n1. **New ADR-124** establishing read-to-me as a core accessibility feature\n2. **Phase 2a additions** for audio UI components\n3. **Phase 3a creation** for recording infrastructure\n4. **Database schema extensions** treating audio as first-class content\n5. **Low-bandwidth optimization** (24 kbps Opus for 2G networks)\n\n## **What Makes This Different**\n\nThis isn't just an audiobook feature. It's designed specifically for:\n- **Illiterate seekers** who may never engage with text\n- **Low-bandwidth delivery** (many illiterate populations have limited internet)\n- **Cultural sensitivity** (gender choice matters in many cultures)\n- **Sacred transmission** (monastic voices preserve the spiritual quality)\n\n## **Critical Questions Raised**\n\nThe proposal surfaces important unstated assumptions:\n- What if monastics can't commit 500+ hours for recording?\n- How do we handle 50+ Hindi dialects?\n- Should we consider sign language video for deaf seekers?\n- Could these recordings reach millions more via podcast platforms?\n\nThis feature would transform the portal from a digital library into a **living voice**, returning to the ancient oral tradition while serving modern accessibility needs. It's not just about compliance or features — it's about ensuring that literacy is not a barrier to receiving Yogananda's teachings.","session_id":"81e44c20-a6fe-461b-871b-dc3f3d02be1e","total_cost_usd":3.6231827500000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":57,"cache_creation_input_tokens":84481,"cache_read_input_tokens":787622,"output_tokens":11398,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":1491,"outputTokens":107,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.002026,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":57,"outputTokens":11398,"cacheReadInputTokens":787622,"cacheCreationInputTokens":84481,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.6211567500000004,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"73a9cb05-0a8f-4411-90c8-c4cbc96ae2c9"}
