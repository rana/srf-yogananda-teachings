The proposal has been written to `/home/rana/prj/srf-yogananda-teachings/.elmer/worktrees/focused-reader-mode-the-reader-and-the-book-nothing-else-no/PROPOSAL.md`.\n\nThe proposal addresses your request for a distraction-free reading experience with these key features:\n\n### Core Concepts Proposed:\n1. **Unified Focused Reader Mode** - Three progressive levels (Standard → Focus → Immerse) that gradually remove UI elements\n2. **Natural Mouse-Over Dwell** - Paragraphs highlight with golden halo effects as you hover, creating fluid contemplative interaction\n3. **Spiritual Eye Visual Treatment** - Uses the portal's navy/gold palette with radial gradients mimicking the third eye meditation glow\n4. **Optional Read-Aloud** - Text-to-speech for eyes-closed contemplation\n5. **Progressive Interaction Depth** - Natural flow from reading → focusing → dwelling → listening\n\n### Key Design Elements:\n- Navy background deepening as immersion increases\n- Golden halo radial gradients (10-20% opacity) around focused text\n- Surrounding text dims to 15% opacity\n- Smooth 300-800ms transitions between states\n- Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility\n- Mobile touch adaptations\n\n### Notable Insights:\n- The proposal builds on existing design elements (DES-009 Dwell mode, DES-011 Meditation Mode, ADR-072 Focus mode)\n- It respects the portal's core principles: Calm Technology, DELTA framework, and \"becoming unnecessary\"\n- Visual treatment connects to SRF meditation practices (spiritual eye symbolism)\n- Progressive enhancement ensures accessibility at every level\n\n### What's Not Being Asked:\nThe proposal also identifies deeper questions about:\n- Reader as meditation tool with breathing synchronization\n- Cultural assumptions about linear vs. non-linear sacred text reading\n- Integration with SRF Lessons practices\n- Sound design possibilities with singing bowls or tampura drones\n- Potential for distributable reader component for other SRF properties\n\nThe proposal provides concrete implementation paths while maintaining the sacred, contemplative nature of Yogananda's teachings and the portal's mission to serve seekers worldwide.","session_id":"5070a9cf-0528-4825-a8ce-967d802ec915","total_cost_usd":3.3008045,"usage":{"input_tokens":52,"cache_creation_input_tokens":95484,"cache_read_input_tokens":763133,"output_tokens":4854,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":280,"outputTokens":134,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.00095,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":52,"outputTokens":4854,"cacheReadInputTokens":763133,"cacheCreationInputTokens":95484,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.2998544999999995,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"f1b3ce29-ac18-42c2-a369-12c2da4a162d"}
