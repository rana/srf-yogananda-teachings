The file PROPOSAL.md has been successfully created at the specified path with a complete analysis of how the SRF Online Teachings Portal can surface and organize Yogananda's teachings about extra-solar life and cosmic consciousness.\n\n## Summary of the Proposal\n\nThe proposal identifies a significant gap in the portal's current thematic coverage — while it focuses on immediate human concerns (Peace, Courage, Healing, etc.), Yogananda's works contain profound teachings about cosmic life, astral worlds, and humanity's place in an inhabited universe.\n\nKey findings:\n\n1. **Architecture Readiness** - The existing portal architecture (theme taxonomy per ADR-032/033, knowledge graph, semantic search) already supports cosmic themes without major changes.\n\n2. **Content Richness** - Yogananda's works, particularly *Autobiography of a Yogi* Chapter 43, *The Second Coming of Christ*, and *God Talks With Arjuna*, contain extensive teachings on astral worlds, life on other planets, and cosmic consciousness.\n\n3. **Modern Relevance** - With UFO disclosures and exoplanet discoveries, seekers increasingly ask questions that Yogananda addressed decades ago from a spiritual perspective.\n\n4. **Implementation Path** - The proposal leverages existing infrastructure (semi-automated tagging pipeline, terminology bridge, multi-category taxonomy) to add cosmic themes without architectural changes.\n\n5. **Sensitive Areas** - The proposal identifies theological questions requiring SRF review, particularly around literal vs. metaphorical interpretation and the intersection with grief/death content.\n\nThe proposal also surfaces important unasked questions about colonialism in spiritual hierarchies, the science-religion boundary, and how to preserve mystical awe while making teachings searchable.\n\nThe PROPOSAL.md file has been successfully written to disk at the specified absolute path, fulfilling the session requirement.","session_id":"56b52af7-2c61-43b0-ab22-85fa6947ec05","total_cost_usd":4.060465000000001,"usage":{"input_tokens":61,"cache_creation_input_tokens":84290,"cache_read_input_tokens":1235475,"output_tokens":8337,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0":{"inputTokens":280,"outputTokens":69,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0006249999999999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0":{"inputTokens":61,"outputTokens":8337,"cacheReadInputTokens":1235475,"cacheCreationInputTokens":84290,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":4.05984,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"f7d45449-4de2-4d17-83a9-09f2d28bbf43"}
