# SRF Yogananda Teachings — Explorations

---
The Contentful-from-Day-One proposal (.elmer/proposals/contentful-from-day-one-two-type-content-model-pdf-to-contentful-to-neon.md) makes three commitments that compound over a decade: (1) Contentful becomes a Phase 0 dependency rather than a Phase 9 addition, (2) a two-type content model (Book + Chapter) replaces the existing four-type model (Book/Chapter/Section/TextBlock), and (3) Rich Text body + JSON pageMap becomes the canonical encoding of sacred text between its physical form and its search index.

For each commitment: What does it depend on that isn't stated? What alternative would a thoughtful dissenter propose? What does the maintainer in 2036 wish we had examined? What breaks when the corpus grows from one narrative book to twenty books spanning verse-commentary, chants, affirmations, and dialogues? What simpler intermediate representation between physical book and search index would serve the same goals with fewer moving parts?

Read the proposal against PRINCIPLES.md (especially Principles 2, 8, 10), ADR-010, ADR-048, and the existing Contentful content model in DESIGN-phase0.md (line 1207+). Ground every observation in a specific document section.
